![Alt text](grafik.png)

We're thrilled to unveil the Python Workgroup at IKZ â€” a dynamic initiative focused on integrating Python into our research landscape. This community-driven effort aims to assist individuals in adopting Python for research data management, fostering a supportive environment for skill development, and promoting collaborative knowledge sharing.

Our goals include building a community where members can learn and exchange best practices, providing project reports to showcase Python's impact, and establishing a learning and discussion platform through regular meetings and workshops. Join us in this exciting venture as we harness the power of Python to enhance research capabilities and cultivate a culture of shared learning at IKZ.
